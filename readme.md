## Getting Started

## Built With

* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework

## Contributing

Please read drop in code, submit a pull request with what it does. This will primarily be used by non-technical folks, so please make it as simple as possible for folks to drop the code right in.

It's gotta be light weight, understandable, and simple, so that anyone can use it. Take a look at the [event-list-widget.html](event-list-widget.html) file for an example.
